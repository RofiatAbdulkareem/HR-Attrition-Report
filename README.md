# HR-Attrition-Report
I worked on HR Analytics for my second internship project at MeriSKILL, where I used data visualization to get important insights regarding the organization's attrition rates. 

These insights are a useful tool for employers to identify the causes of employee turnover and implement the required changes to work practices and policies to keep their best workers. These are the main conclusions:

KEY INSIGHTS
1. The department with the highest attrition rate was research and development.
  
2. Extra time workdays were a major factor in attrition.
    
3. Compared to other employment levels, entry-level employees had the highest attrition rate.
 
4. Compared to their female coworkers, male employees were more likely to quit.
   
5. The group of workers most likely to leave the company was those between the ages of 31 and 45.
 
6. Surveys taken by departing employees revealed that they were unhappy with their workplace.
 
7. The company's total attrition rate of 16% indicated areas in need of development.
    
8. When compared to their married and divorced colleagues, single employees had the highest attrition rate.
    
9. A greater attrition rate was substantially correlated with overtime work.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

📍Encourage career development for male employees aged 18-45 years, as they are in their prime career-building years.

📍 Consider improving compensation and benefits for employees working overtime.

📍Support entry-level employees in pursuing further education and career advancement, providing opportunities for skill development.

📍 Implement mentorship programs and promote knowledge sharing within the organization.

📍Enhance employee satisfaction through tailored strategies such as salary and benefits reviews, performance recognition, etc.

📍Boost employee satisfaction by fostering social interactions, transparency, wellness programs, and creating an excellent working environment to reduce attrition.
